Eye Movement Data Analysis Toolkit (EMDAT) is a library for processing eye gaze data, developed in the University of British Columbia. Currently EMDAT is able to use data exported from Tobii studio and SMI software for analysis. While Tobii studio and SMI enable researchers to perform limited analysis on the eye gaze data collected by an eye tracker in an experiment, EMDAT can be used to calculate a comprehensive list of eye gaze features for each participant. Additionally, EMDAT has built-in mechanisms for data preprocessing and clean up which makes it a valuable toolkit for researchers. EMDAT is developed with generalizability in mind, so that it can be used for a variety of experiments, with no or minimal amount of changes in the code provided. 

In order to run EMDAT you will need a Python version 2.6.* or 2.7.* distribution with the NumPy package.
